Five Nights at Timmies is a Windows Forms mystery exploration game where you find clues, solve puzzles, and escape a cursed breakroom. Your goal is to collect four hidden slips of paper, use them to unlock a door, and explore the final hallway to complete your escape.

How to Start the Game

When the game opens, you'll see a still black screen. Click anywhere on the screen to begin. An animated blinking sequence will play, simulating you waking up in the breakroom. Once the animation finishes, the main game begins with the breakroom in front of you.

Navigating the Breakroom

The breakroom consists of three main views: the center view (which you start in), the left view, and the right view. You can rotate between these views by clicking the left and right arrow buttons at the bottom of the screen. Each view has objects you can interact with.

In the center view, you'll find the fridge, the coffee machine, and the main breakroom door. On the left side, there's a mess of spilled timbits and a note please click within this area. On the right side there is a fallen table with a job application, please click the job application. You are free to explore these views in any order. 
Every page has a go back button or access to arrow keys to allow you to progress or come back to an area at anytime.


Collecting the Four Slips

Your first objective is to find four slips of paper, each hidden in a different area of the breakroom.

* To find the first slip, click on the coffee machine. A video will play of the machine brewing a drink. Once it finishes, the screen will show the slip, and you’ll be able to go back to the main room using the go back button in the top right corner.

* For the second slip, click on the fridge. When it opens, click on the raccoon. It will reveal another slip you may return with the go back button.

* The third slip is found by turning to the left side of the room and clicking on the spilled timbits spille don the floor. This will change the background to show the slip.

* The fourth slip is behind the job poster. Turn to the right side of the room, click on the poster, and then click on the job posting itself. This reveals the final slip.

Once you’ve found all four slips, the breakroom door code becomes accessible.

Attempting to use the door before all 4 slips are collected will result in a redirection message.


Unlocking the Breakroom Door

When you click the breakroom door after collecting all four slips, you’ll be asked to enter a code. The hint refers to the “most evil Organizer Manager you know.” The correct answer is “erin”. Entering this code correctly unlocks the hallway and opens the next stage of the game.

Exploring the Hallway

After unlocking the door, you’ll be taken into a new hallway with four new buttons: Storage Room, Washroom, Manager’s Room, and Escape. These rooms can also be explored in any order, but before you can escape, you’ll need to find three key parts—one in each of the first three rooms.

* In the Storage Room, you must check different boxes. Only one contains the actual key part. When you find it, the scene will "save" your progress.

* In the Washroom, click the toilet seat, then the contents inside to uncover another key part.

* In the Manager’s Room, click  the pink purse to find the final key piece. The room will change once it has been found.

Once all three parts are collected, the Escape button becomes active.

Escaping

Click the Escape button. Erin will demand a joke before letting you go. You’ll be prompted to type a joke into a text box. If you submit a blank joke or if Erin doesn’t find it funny (randomly decided), a video will play showing your failure. If Erin finds your joke funny, you’ll be rewarded with a better ending video. Either way, the final background image will display and the game will conclude.


* Explore carefully and don’t be afraid to click around.
* You can always return to the main breakroom by clicking “Go Back.” while in the hallway
* The hallway also has its own “Go Back” button to return from any room.

Enjoy escaping from Five Nights at Timmies. Good luck surviving Erin.
